		  <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
			<h3>The Birth of the Burgeritto</h3>
			<p>IT WAS A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT IN THE YEAR 2000. I HAD JUST ARRIVED AT MY FAIRFIELD BAR,
				SKYBOX CAFE. I STOMPED THE SNOW OFF MY BOOTS AND HUNGRILY HEADED FOR THE GRILL. FAMISHED, AS USUAL, I THREW A BURGER ON
				THE GRILL AND TOPPED IT WITH MY FINEST AMERICAN CHEESE. BUT, JUST AS I WAS ANTICIPATING THAT DELICIOUS FIRST BITE,
				DISASTER STRUCK! I HAD NO HAMBURGER BUNS. FRANTIC FOR MY HAMBURGER, THE DELICIOUS AROMA TANTALIZING ME, I LOOKED AROUND
				FOR A SOLUTION AND SPOTTED THE FLOUR TORTILLAS. NECESSITY BEING THE MOTHER OF INVENTION, I GRABBED A TORTILLA AND PUT
				MY BURGER WITH MELTED CHEESE ATOP. THINKING IT MIGHT BE BLAND, I ADDED SOME ACCOUTREMENTS, NAMELY DICED TOMATO,
				ROMAINE LETTUCE, CRUMBLED BACON AND TOMATO-MAYO
			</p>
			<p>"WOW!!" WAS THE FIRST WORD I SPOKE AFTER MY INITIAL BITE, AS THE HEAVENS OPENED UP AND BRIGHT LIGHT SHONE UPON ME,
				"I'M ON TO SOMETHING BIG. AS I'VE BEEN TOLD MANY TIMES THAT I'M A LEGEND IN MY OWN MIND, I KNEW INSTANTLY I HAD
				STUMBLED UPON THE NEXT HOT, MUST-HAVE FOOD ITEM. BUT, BEING A MODEST GUY, I THOUGHT I SHOULD CHECK WITH MY CUSTOMERS
				TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE. AFTER 30-40 PEOPLE TRIED ONE, TO A PERSON, THEY ALL AGREED MY NEW TASTE SENSATION WAS AWESOME.
		 </p>
		 <p>OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, CUSTOMERS KEPT COMING IN AND ASKING FOR "THAT BURGER THING - OTHERS DESCRIBED IT AS 'THE BURGER
			 TORTILLA" AND SOME CALLED IT "THE BURGER BURITTO." NO ONE KNEW WHAT TO CALL IT BUT THEY ALL KNEW THEY WANTED IT.
		 </p>
		 <p>SO I KNEW IT WAS TIME TO NAME MY NEW CREATION AND I CALLED IT THE BURGERITTO. THE NAME MAY SOUND STRANGE AT FIRST, BUT
			 TRUST ME, ONCE YOU TRY ONE, YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF SAYING OVER AND OVER AGAIN "I'LL HAVE A BURGERITTO."
